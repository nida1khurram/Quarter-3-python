    "There are times where you are working with lots of different data within a function that you want to return. While generally, we want to keep functions to have a precise purpose, sometimes that purpose just deals with multiple bits of data.\n",

    "To practice this, imagine we are working on a program where the user needs to enters data to sign up for a website. Fill out the get_user_data() function which:\n",

    "(Note. This idea is called tuple packing/unpacking. We \"pack\" our return values into a single data structure called a tuple. We can then \"unpack\" these values back into our original values or leave them as a tuple.)"
