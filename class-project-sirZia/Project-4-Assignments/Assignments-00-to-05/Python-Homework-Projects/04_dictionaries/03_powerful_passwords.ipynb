    "This can be done via something called hashing. Hashing is when we take something and convert it into a different, unique identifier. This is done using a hash function. Luckily, there are several resources that can help us with this.\n",

    "(Hint. You will need to use the provided hash_password(...) function. You don't necessarily need to know how it works, just know that hash_password(...) returns the hash for the password!)"
