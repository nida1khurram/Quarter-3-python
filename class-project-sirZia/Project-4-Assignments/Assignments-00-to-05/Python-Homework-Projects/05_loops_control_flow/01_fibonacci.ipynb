    "Write a program to print terms in the Fibonacci sequence up to a maximum value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 13th century, the Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci, as a way to explain the geometric growth of a population of rabbits, devised a mathematical sequence that now bears his name. The first two terms in this sequence, Fib(0) and Fib(1), are 0 and 1, and every subsequent term is the sum of the preceding two. Thus, the first several terms in the Fibonacci sequence look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fib(0) = 0 Fib(1) = 1 Fib(2) = 1 = 0 + 1 Fib(3) = 2 = 1 + 1 Fib(4) = 3 = 1 + 2 Fib(5) = 5 = 2 + 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that displays the terms in the Fibonacci sequence, starting with Fib(0) and continuing as long as the terms are less than 10,000 (you should store this value as a constant!). Thus, your program should produce the following sample run:\n",
